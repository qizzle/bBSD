Want to help translating bDBS? Sure thing, _but_ please do it following these steps:

    - Use "de-DE.json" or some different translation as reference. (documentation coming soon)
    - If a language file (.json) already has been created for your langauge, please don't create a new one and
    just edit the existing one.
    - If you want to translate a new language, which hasn't been translated before,
    please use the IETF language tag scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_code) for the file name.
    E.g. "en-US.json", "de-DE.json", "fr-FR.json"
    - Following is prohibited in a translation: swears, use of sexual words, racism and discrimination.
    - Publishing your translation on the offical bDBS github repo will result it to be licensed
    under the GPL-3.0 License and will be intergrated into bDBS (once accepted).

Thanks!
