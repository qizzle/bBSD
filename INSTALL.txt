Thanks for downloading Better Bot Studio for Discord (bBSD)!

bBSD only runs on Windows and there'll be no support for other operating system for now.

Requirements:
	- Legal Copy of Bot Studio for Discord (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118380/Bot_Studio_for_Discord/)
	- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/	or	if you have Chocolatey installed, in cmd "choco install nodejs" and restart cmd)

This is how you install the modifaction:
	1. Open your Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and goto to your just downloaded bBSD folder.
		cd 'C:\Users\schnitzel\Desktop\bbsd'
	2. Now execute the following command:
		node install.js
	This will execute the install script.
	3. Now from your Explorer copy the path of your Bot Studio for Discord installation.
		E.g. 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bot Studio for Discord'
	4. Paste the path (just click Right Click in cmd) in the install script and press Enter.
	5. bBSD now will be installed. Wait for the "Installed bBSD successfully!".
	6. Run Bot Studio for Discord and enjoy!
